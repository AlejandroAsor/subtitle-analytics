# English Movie and Series Word Frequencies

This repository contains lists of English words frequently used in movies and series. The data was collected and analyzed to provide insight into the language used in English media, which can be helpful for linguistic research, natural language processing tasks, or language learning purposes.

## Data Source

The word frequencies were extracted from the English language subtitle files of the OpenSubtitles2018 corpus. The corpus includes sentence-aligned subtitle files for 62 languages, with a total of 3,735,070 files and 22.10G tokens.

The OpenSubtitles corpus is freely available for research purposes. For more information, visit http://www.opensubtitles.org/.
